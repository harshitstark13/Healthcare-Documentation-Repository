# NLP Data Cleaning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`NLP-Cleaning.ipynb`) focusing on the data cleaning process for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. NLP data cleaning is an essential step in text analysis projects as it ensures the quality and consistency of the data, leading to more accurate insights and models.

## About NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. Data cleaning is a crucial initial step in NLP projects to prepare the text data for analysis and modeling.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Scraps From The Loft](http://scrapsfromtheloft.com) and consists of transcripts from various stand-up comedians. These transcripts serve as the raw text data for our NLP cleaning and analysis.

## NLP Cleaning

The `NLP-Cleaning.ipynb` notebook outlines the following key steps in the NLP data cleaning process:

1. **Getting the Data**: Obtaining the raw text data from the source website.
2. **Cleaning the Data**: Performing data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, standardizing text data, and dropping duplicates.
3. **Organizing the Data**: Organizing the cleaned data into standard text formats, including a corpus and a document-term matrix for further analysis.

## Additional Assignments

The notebook also includes additional assignments for further exploration and understanding of NLP data cleaning techniques. These assignments involve adding regular expressions for text cleaning and experimenting with CountVectorizer parameters to customize the text processing pipeline.

## Usage

To use this notebook, simply clone the repository and run the `NLP-Cleaning.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment. Make sure to install the necessary libraries listed in the notebook's imports section.

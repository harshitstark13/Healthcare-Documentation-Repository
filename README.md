## About NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. Data cleaning is a crucial initial step in NLP projects to prepare the text data for analysis and modeling.

## Data

The "Healthcare Documentation Database" is a concise yet comprehensive collection of medical transcriptions spanning various specialties and patient encounters. Each entry includes a brief description of the medical encounter, categorized by specialty and accompanied by a unique sample name for easy reference.

## NLP Data Cleaning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`NLP-Cleaning.ipynb`) focusing on the data cleaning process for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. NLP data cleaning is an essential step in text analysis projects as it ensures the quality and consistency of the data, leading to more accurate insights and models.
This section covers various text preprocessing techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Each method plays a crucial role in preparing the text data for analysis and modeling by ensuring consistency, removing noise, and extracting meaningful information.

## Cleaning The Data

### Handling Missing Values

Data cleaning often involves handling missing values, which can adversely affect the performance of NLP models. In the code, missing values in specific columns (`description`, `medical_specialty`, `sample_name`, `transcription`, `keywords`) are identified and removed using pandas' `dropna()` function. This ensures that only complete and relevant data entries are retained for further processing.

### Standardizing Text Data

Text data often contains inconsistencies such as different capitalization, punctuation, and formatting styles. Standardizing the text data involves converting it into a uniform format to facilitate analysis. In the code, the `standardize_text()` function is applied to the `transcription` column, converting all text to lowercase. This ensures that words with different capitalizations are treated as identical, reducing redundancy and improving text matching accuracy.

### Dropping Duplicates

Duplicate entries in the dataset can skew the analysis results and lead to inaccuracies. Therefore, removing duplicates is an essential step in data cleaning. The `drop_duplicates()` function is applied to eliminate duplicate rows based on their content, ensuring that each transcription entry is unique within the dataset.

## NLP Text Cleaning Function

### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens. In NLP, tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step that enables further analysis, such as word frequency counts and sentiment analysis. In the code, the `nltk.word_tokenize()` function is used to tokenize the text data, splitting it into a list of words.

### Stopword Removal

Stopwords are common words that occur frequently in text but often carry little semantic meaning (e.g., "the", "and", "is"). Removing stopwords is a crucial step in NLP preprocessing to reduce noise and focus on meaningful words. In the code, stopwords are removed using the `stop_words` set from the NLTK library, ensuring that only relevant words are retained for analysis.

### Lemmatization

Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run", "cats" to "cat"). It helps normalize the text data and improve the accuracy of subsequent analyses by treating different forms of the same word as identical. In the code, the NLTK WordNet lemmatizer (`nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer()`) is applied to lemmatize the tokens, ensuring consistency in word representation.

### Removing Non-Alphanumeric Characters and URLs

Non-alphanumeric characters and URLs are often considered noise in text data and can be removed to focus on meaningful content. In the code, regular expressions (`re.sub()`) are used to remove non-alphanumeric characters and URLs from the tokenized text, ensuring that only alphanumeric words are retained for analysis.

## Applying Text Cleaning and Checking DataFrame after Cleaning

After applying the NLP text cleaning methods, the cleaned text data is stored in a new column (`cleaned_transcription`) in the DataFrame. This column contains the processed text data ready for further analysis, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or classification tasks. The DataFrame is then checked to ensure that the cleaning process has been applied successfully, and the text data is ready for downstream NLP tasks.

These NLP cleaning methods collectively help transform raw text data into a clean, structured format suitable for various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. By removing noise, standardizing text formats, and extracting meaningful information, these preprocessing techniques lay the foundation for accurate and insightful text analysis.
